# Football-League-Sim-Tkinter

This is my project which I started in the summer of 2024 and worked on it throughout the rest of the year. 
This application allows users to create tournaments and teams which they can then simulate however many times they desire.
The app includes:
- Real time league table
- Match information such as scorers, lineups and more
- League statistics such as top scorer, assister and more#
- Real time position and points graphs
- League all-time records and past seasons statistics\n
As well as the ability to:
- Create an unlimited amount of teams
- Choose and personalise a logo
- Choice to create players or let the program do it automatically
- See and examine player statistics over multiple seasons
